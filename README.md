'''Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:


1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.

     num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   	
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is Even")
else:
    print(f"{num} is Odd")'''


    Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

result = 0
for i in range(1,51):
    print(i)
    result += i
print(f"The result is {result}")
